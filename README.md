# Bucket List 2022

My personal bucket list for 2022. Hope I will made it to this list. I will update the items on the list with links to the repos when I'm done with one of them.

 - [ ] Read water meter and get it in Loon Home. Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDIJEyElkAU&t=1222s).
 - [ ] Translate and improve my port scanner Pluto from [Python](https://github.com/dlothmann/pluto) to C++
 - [ ] Create my own version of an led ping pong wall. My inspiration is from bittuni's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZEMK-C-nSo)
 - [ ] Learn Docker Basics.
